Mission Space Lab is part of the European Astro Pi Challenge, an ESA Education project run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation for young people aged under 19 in [ESA Member States](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/eligibility), Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Canada and Malta.

Mission Space Lab involves writing a computer program to run on one of the two Astro Pi units on the International Space Station, in order to conduct a scientific experiment exploring life on Earth or life in space. NDVI is a great way to use the camera on the Astro Pi to measure plant health on Earth.

Here is an example of NDVI images from the Astro Pi unit called Izzy. Izzy has a Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera pointed out of the window of the ISS that can be used to capture images of Earth.

If you would like to practise using NDVI on images taken from the ISS, you can use the image below, or look at the images in the [resources folder for this project](https://rpf.io/p/en/astropi-ndvi-get){:target="_blank"}.
