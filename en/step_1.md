## Introduction

In this project, you will learn how to use images, taken with a camera fitted with special filters, to measure the health of plants. If you have access to a Raspberry Pi Camera module, you will also learn how to modify it so it can be used to take these photos.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Filters**</span> can be used on cameras to prevent some wavelenghts of light from reaching the sensor. For instance, most digital cameras have an infrared filter to stop infrared light from reaching the sensor.

You will:
+ Learn what is meant by Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
+ How to convert an image taken with a modified camera so that it can be used to measure NDVI
+ How to modify a Raspberry Pi camera module, so it can be used to take NDVI images.
